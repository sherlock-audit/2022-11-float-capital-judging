# Upgradeable contract is missing a `__gap[50]` storage variable to allow for new storage variables in later versions

## Summary
PoolToken.sol Missing Storage Gaps

## Vulnerability Detail

See [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps) link for a description of this storage variable. While some contracts may not currently be sub-classed, adding the variable now protects against forgetting to add it in the future.

```solidity
contract PoolToken is AccessControlledAndUpgradeable, ERC20Upgradeable, ERC20BurnableUpgradeable, ERC20PermitUpgradeable, IPoolToken {
  /// @notice Role that is assigned to the single entity that is allowed to call mint
  bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");
```
