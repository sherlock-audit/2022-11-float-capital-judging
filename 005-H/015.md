# Constructor With Upgradable Contracts

## Summary

Upgradable contracts must not have a `constructor()`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

[`MarketLiquidityManagerSimple`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-float-capital/blob/main/contracts/YieldManagers/MarketLiquidityManagerSimple.sol#L40)

State that is set via a traditional constructor will not be executed within the context of the contract.

## Impact

- Variable assignments will not be set correctly at deploy time for the market and payment token

## Code Snippet

```solidity
constructor(address _market, address _paymentToken) initializer {
    require(_market != address(0) && _paymentToken != address(0));
    market = _market;
    paymentToken = IERC20(_paymentToken);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Use the `initialize()` function for assigning state at deploy time. For more information please see https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies#the-constructor-caveat
