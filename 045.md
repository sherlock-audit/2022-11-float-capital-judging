# Unsafe type casting of `poolValue` can malfunction the whole market

## Summary

When `poolValue` is a negative number due to loss in `valueChange` and `funding`, the unsafe type casting from `int256` to `uint256` will result in a huge number close to `2**255` which will revert `_rebalancePoolsAndExecuteBatchedActions()` due to overflow when multiplied by 1e18 at L163.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the funding rate is 100% per year and the `EPOCH_LENGTH` is 4 days, the funding fee for each epoch can be as much as ~1% on the effectiveValue.

Plus, the loss from `valueChange` is capped at 99%, but combining both can still result in a negative `poolValue` at L146.

At L163 `uint256 price = uint256(poolValue).div(tokenSupply);` the type casting from `int256` to `uint256` will result in a huge number close to `2**255`.

`MathUintFloat.div()` will overflow when a number as large as `2**255` is multiplied by 1e18.

## Impact

`_rebalancePoolsAndExecuteBatchedActions` will revert and cause the malfunction of the whole market.
