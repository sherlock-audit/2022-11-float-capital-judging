# Use `SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol` for Upgradeable contracts

## Summary
Use `SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol` for Upgradable contracts
Found by: @tomosuke0930

## Vulnerability Detail
If contracts use the upgradable library of Open Zeppelin, use the `SafeERC20Upgradable.sol` instead of `SafeERC20.sol`.
The reasons are as follows.
> SafeERC20 and SafeERC20Upgradeable are the same. The reasons we rename it are 1) to make it clear that the code is safe for upgradeability, and 2) to avoid potential clashes with the original one.
You can use either. If you're using the Upgrades plugins to check safety (which you should), then this is ok. If you're not using them, I would recommend sticking to the Upgradeable variant because it gives you a better guarantee of safety.

## Impact
It has a potential clashes with the original one without using `SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol` instead of `SafeERC20.sol`

```solidity
[contract MarketCore is AccessControlledAndUpgradeableModifiers, IMarketCommon, IMarketCore, MarketStorage, ProxyNonPayable {
  using SafeERC20 for IERC20;](https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-11-float-capital-UNCHAIN/blob/main/contracts/market/template/MarketCore.sol#L8-L9)
```

```solidity
contract MarketExtendedCore is AccessControlledAndUpgradeableModifiers, MarketStorage, IMarketExtendedCore {
  using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
```

https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-11-float-capital-UNCHAIN/blob/main/contracts/YieldManagers/MarketLiquidityManagerSimple.sol#L10-L11

```solidity
contract MarketLiquidityManagerSimple is ILiquidityManager, AccessControlledAndUpgradeable {
  using SafeERC20 for IERC20;
```
