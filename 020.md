# Users will lose value if `paymentToken` is a fee-on-transfer or a rebasing token

## Summary
If fee-on-transfer or rebasing token is used as `paymentToken` in a Market, then the logic in `settlePoolUserRedeems` will work incorrectly and will revert for the last users to call it, since there won't be enough liquidity in the liquidity manager.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. STA, PAXG), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. USDT, USDC). Notice: `USDC` is named specifically to be used in the protocol docs.
Also, some tokens may make arbitrary balance modifications outside of transfers (e.g. Ampleforth style rebasing tokens, Compound style airdrops of governance tokens, mintable / burnable tokens).

In both cases, if a protocol caches the amount transferred (as `MarketCore` does with `userAction.amount`) then the contract might be operating with wrong or outdated values for the balance of a user.
When a user calls any of the `mint` methods, he passes an `amount` argument of the amount of paymentTokens to be transferred out of his wallet. The code then caches that user provided amount with `userAction.amount += amount;` even though this might not be the actual amount transferred (or in case of a rebasing token, this can be an outdated value later). 
Now when a user calls the `settlePoolUserRedeems()` function, the code does the following:
`uint256 amountPaymentTokenToSend = uint256(userAction.amount).mul(poolToken_price);`
and transfers out `amountPaymentTokenToSend` to him. If the `liquidityManager` did not actually contain `userAction.amount` of tokens, this can result in the last users calling `settlePoolUserRedeems` being unable to do so, because the transfer from the `liquidityManager` to them reverts due to insufficient liquidity.

## Impact
Impact will be a loss of value for users due to DoS on `settlePoolUserRedeems`. Putting this as `High` severity, because `USDC` is explicitly pointed out in docs to be used, but it is an upgradeable contract which already has hooks implemented into it and it is possible that it adds a fee in the future.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For fee-on-transfer tokens, it is best to check the balance before and after the transfer, to see the actually received value. For rebasing tokens it's best to add an `allowlist` functionality for ERC20 tokens.
