# Dangerously implemented `initialize` function might be front-ran maliciously, resulting in stolen funds or DoS

## Summary
Initialize functions & upgradeability have brought problems to lots of protocols. The highest bug bounty on Immunefi is $10M uninitialized contract bug. Currently `MarketLiquidityManagerSimple` has an external `initialize` method, that sets the `admin` of the contract who has power to upgrade it. Since the function is external it can be front ran right after an update.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `MarketLiquidityManagerSimple` contract has the `initialize` function which is callable by anyone (external) and sets the admin of the contract who has the power to upgrade it. Now in the scenario of an upgrade to `MarketLiquidityManagerSimple` if for some reason the `initialize` method is not called in the same transaction of the upgrade, an attacker can front-ran or just call the `initialize()` method and set himself as the `admin`. Right after this he can put in a transaction that will upgrade the `MarketLiquidityManagerSimple` to an implementation that has a `stealERC20()` functionality, or just to an implementation with a `selfdestruct` opcode that gets called and results in the contract bricked.

## Impact
The impact of front-running `initialize()` calls or uninitialized upgraded contract can be loss of 100% of TVL or a permanent DoS of the protocol.

## Recommendation
Change `MarketLiquidityManagerSimple` to be non-upgradeable, or allow the `initialize()` method be called only from a governance owned account.
