# Pools cannot be initialized because of incorrectly used initializer modifier

## Summary

The `MarketExtended.sol:initializePools()` function is called as a `delegatecall` from MarketCore.sol. This function has an `initializer` modifier, but MarketCore.sol will have already run a function with an `initializer` modifier. The result is that this function cannot be called, and pools cannot be initialized.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `initializer` modifier from OpenZeppelin only allows a function to be called once, and then writes the storage variable `_initialized = true` to ensure it is not called again.

```solidity
    modifier initializer() {
        bool isTopLevelCall = !_initializing;
        require(
            (isTopLevelCall && _initialized < 1) || (!AddressUpgradeable.isContract(address(this)) && _initialized == 1),
            "Initializable: contract is already initialized"
        );
        _initialized = 1;
        if (isTopLevelCall) {
            _initializing = true;
        }
        _;
        if (isTopLevelCall) {
            _initializing = false;
            emit Initialized(1);
        }
    }
```
Because the `initializePools()` function is called as a `delegatecall` from MarketCore.sol, it will operate on the storage of the calling contract. This storage already has an `_initialized` variable, which will have been set to `true` by the `initializer` modifier on MarketCore.sol's constructor.

[Here is a Gist with a copy & paste Forge test that can be used to verify the error.](https://gist.github.com/zobront/6103228bf131fa99ad658ef0f89a0e78)

## Impact

The `initializePools()` function is required for the market to operate. Without this function being called, no market will be able to add an admin, setup roles, connect to an oracle, set a liquidity manager, set maxPercentChange or set latestExecutedEpochIndex correctly to begin operating.

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

Remove the `initializer` modifier from the constructor in MarketCore.sol.
