# PoolToken fails to override ERC20BurnableUpgradeable#burnFrom allowing ordinary user to burn tokens

## Summary

PoolToken inherits ERC20BurnableUpgradeable. It overrides ERC20BurnableUpgradeable#burn to prevent the user from burning their own shares. It fails to override ERC20BurnableUpgradeable#burnFrom allowing ordinary users to burn tokens. Submitting as medium risk since user is allowed to perform an otherwise permissioned action.

## Vulnerability Detail

    ERC20BurnableUpgradeable.sol

    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual {
        _spendAllowance(account, _msgSender(), amount);
        _burn(account, amount);
    }

ERC20BurnableUpgradeable contains a secondary burn function, burnFrom. PoolToken overrides ERC20BurnableUpgradeable#burn to prevent users from burning their own tokens. It doesn't override ERC20BurnableUpgradeable#burnFrom at all allowing any user to call it and burn their tokens. Burning tokens is meant to be permissioned action and failure to override burnFrom allows an unpermissioned user to perform an otherwise permissioned action

## Impact

Unpermissioned user is allowed to perform an otherwise permissioned action
