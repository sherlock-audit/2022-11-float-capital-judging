# PoolToken fails to override ERC20BurnableUpgradeable#burnFrom allowing users to burn tokens and recieve nothing in return

## Summary

PoolToken inherits ERC20BurnableUpgradeable. It overrides ERC20BurnableUpgradeable#burn to prevent the user from burning their own shares. It fails to override ERC20BurnableUpgradeable#burnFrom allowing ordinary users to burn tokens. If burned in this manner then user will lose all their funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

    ERC20BurnableUpgradeable.sol

    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public virtual {
        _spendAllowance(account, _msgSender(), amount);
        _burn(account, amount);
    }

ERC20BurnableUpgradeable contains a secondary burn function, burnFrom. PoolToken overrides ERC20BurnableUpgradeable#burn to prevent users from burning their own tokens. It doesn't override ERC20BurnableUpgradeable#burnFrom at all allowing any user to call it and burn their tokens. Burning tokens is meant to be permissioned action and failure to override burnFrom allows an user to burn their tokens without receiving any tokens in return, causing loss of funds.

## Impact

User will burn their tokens and not receive anything in return causing loss of funds
