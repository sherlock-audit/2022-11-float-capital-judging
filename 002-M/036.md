# Unsupported transfer with fee token

## Summary
Unsupported transfer with fee token
Found by: @Tomosuke0930

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens(e.g. `STA`, `PAXG` ,in the future `USDC`, `USDT`), allow for charging a fee any time `transfer()` or `transferFrom()` is called.

For more detail, please read this.

[https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer%5D(https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20%23fee-on-transfer))

Assume that `XYZ` token is a fee-on-transfer token with a 10% transfer fee.

Assume that the user sent 100 XYZ tokens.

The accounting system set the amount to 100 but the actual amount of XYZ tokens received by the vault will only be 90 XYZ tokens.

## Impact
Internal accounting issues occur due to not support for the fee-on-transfer or rebasing token

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-11-float-capital-UNCHAIN/blob/e167ac24613e02748aad72c1d216283225733355/contracts/market/template/MarketCore.sol#L252
```solidity
function _mint(
    uint112 amount,
    address user,
    PoolType poolType,
    uint256 poolTier
  ) internal {
    if (uint256(poolTier) >= _numberOfPoolsOfType[uint256(poolType)]) revert InvalidPool();

    if (mintingPaused) revert MintingPaused();

    // Due to get amount of payment token calculation we must have amount * 1e18 > poolTokenPriceInPaymentTokens otherwise we get 0
    // In fact, all the decimals of amount * 1e18 that are less than poolTokenPriceInPaymentTokens get cut off
    if (amount < 1e18) revert InvalidActionAmount(amount);
    IERC20(paymentToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, liquidityManager, amount);
  
    /// NOTE: userAction.amount > 0 IFF userAction.correspondingEpoch <= currentEpoch - this check is redundant for safety.
    if (userAction.amount > 0 && userAction.correspondingEpoch < currentEpoch) {
      userAction.nextEpochAmount += amount;
    } else {
      userAction.amount += amount;
      userAction.correspondingEpoch = currentEpoch;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that to check previous balance/after balance equals to amount for any rebasing/inflation/deflation.

Create a whitelist in contracts to restrict token addresses.
