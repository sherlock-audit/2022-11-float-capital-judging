# Development Libraries In Production

## Summary

`MarketExtended` imports and uses `MarketStorage`. This imported library contains a Forge development library used for build.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`MarketStorage`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-float-capital/blob/main/contracts/market/template/MarketStorage.sol#L19)

This imports the Forge standard library. As well as causing a higher cost for deployment, this necessitates the redeployment without this library which would incur maintainers of the project as well as migration costs for users.

## Impact

- Higher deployment cost owing to a greater bytecode size
- Migration costs for users to move from the existing contract to a version without development libraries

## Code Snippet

```solidity
import "forge-std/console2.sol";
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Remove this library import from the file
