# `totalFunding` can be much higher than expected when the float pool's liquidity is low

## Summary

The float pool will receive funding fees from all other long/short pools. However, the actual `floatPoolLeverage` depends on the liquidity of the float pool and the imbalance of both sides.

When the float pool's liquidity is too low, `totalFunding` can be much at a higher rate to the amount of the float liquidity added to the underbalanced side.

## Vulnerability Detail

For example, if there is only $1 in the float pool, the actual `floatPoolLeverage` will be negligible.

When the short side has $1M with a 10x leverage, then `effectiveValueShort` will be `$10M`, and the long side is only $100 at 2x leverage.

However, `totalFunding` will be calculated based on $20M.

The short side will be paying much more funding fees to the float pool while the float is not actually providing the leverage for it.

## Impact

Higher funding fees than expected.
