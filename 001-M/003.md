# Chainlink Oracle's `latestRoundData()` function may return price data which is not fresh or incorrect price data in results

## Summary
- Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` function is used but there is no check if the return value indicates price data which is not fresh. This could lead to getting price data which is not fresh. 
  (This is according to the Chainlink documentation: https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds )

## Vulnerability Detail
- Chainlink Oracle's `latestRoundData()` function  is used in the `initializePools()` function in the MarketExtended.sol for getting the latest price. 
  - However, there is no check if the return value indicates the price data which is not fresh.

## Impact
- The result of calling `oracleManager.chainlinkOracle().latestRoundData()` could return price data which is not fresh. Then, the price data which is not fresh will be assigned into the variable of `"initialAssetPrice"` . 
  (Also, it will be emitted when the `SeparateMarketLaunchedAndSeeded()` event will be emitted in the `initializePools()` function in the MarketExtended.sol)

## Code Snippet
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-float-capital/blob/main/contracts/market/template/MarketExtended.sol#L37
```solidity
    (uint80 latestRoundId, int256 initialAssetPrice, , , ) = oracleManager.chainlinkOracle().latestRoundData();
```

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
- In order to avoid getting the price data which is not fresh, I recommend adding checks whether returned-price data is fresh or not like below:  
```solidity
(uint80 latestRoundId, int256 initialAssetPrice, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = oracleManager.chainlinkOracle().latestRoundData();

require(answeredInRound >= latestRoundId, "Price is not fresh");
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < PRICE_ORACLE_THRESHOLD_WHICH_IS_NOT_FRESH, "Price round incomplete");
```
