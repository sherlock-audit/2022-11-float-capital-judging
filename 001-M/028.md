```solidity
    (uint80 latestRoundId, int256 initialAssetPrice, , , ) = oracleManager.chainlinkOracle().latestRoundData();
    epochInfo.latestExecutedOracleRoundId = latestRoundId;

```solidity
(uint80 latestRoundId,initialAssetPrice,, uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = oracleManager.chainlinkOracle().latestRoundData();

require(answeredInRound >= latestRoundId, "Stale price");
require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete");
```
