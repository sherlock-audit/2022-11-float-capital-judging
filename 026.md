# Pool initialization without oracle input sanitization can lead to using a zero or stale `roundId` and `price`

## Summary
The code in `MarketExtended` has an external oracle call but doesn't correctly validate the returned data.

## Vulnerability Detail
The code in `MarketExtended` is `(uint80 latestRoundId, int256 initialAssetPrice, , , ) = oracleManager.chainlinkOracle().latestRoundData();` but it does no validations on the received data from the external call. Chainlink's docs recommend always validating the returned results, since they can be 0 or stale.

## Impact
If the ChainlinkOracle returns a zero or stale `roundId` then the code will cache 0 as `epochInfo.latestExecutedOracleRoundId`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the `latestRoundData()` call code to the following:
```jsx
(roundId, rawPrice,, updatedAt, answeredInRound) = oracleManager.chainlinkOracle().latestRoundData();
require(rawPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
```
