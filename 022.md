# Compromised or malicious admin can rug 100% of TVL

## Summary
This is a classic elevated privileges issue. The `admin` in `MarketLiquidityManagerSimple` can upgrade and rug 100% of TVL any time without any restrictions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `MarketLiquidityManagerSimple` contract holds all of the TVL of the protocol, but it is an upgradeable contract. The admin that can upgrade it is set in `initialize` as the `admin` address argument. If this account is compromised or turns malicious it might steal all of the TVL by just upgrading the contract to an implementation with ERC20 transfer functionality that only `owner` can call.

## Impact
This can result in permanent value loss for users of the protocol, but it requires a malicious or a compromised owner, hence it's a Medium severity vulnerability

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either make the `MarketLiquidityManagerSimple` contract non-upgradeable or use a governance/timelock account to be the `owner` of it.
