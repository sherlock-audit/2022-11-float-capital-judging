# `valueChange` should be applied to long and short differently according to the `poolType`

## Summary

`params.valueChange` will be a negative number when the `priceMovement` is negative, ie, the price is going down. In this case, the long side should be losing money to the short side. 

The current implementation will wrongfully decrease poolValue from the short side. And vice versa.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of `_rebalancePoolsAndExecuteBatchedActions()`, both the long side and the short side will go into the branch of L138-150.

At L146-147, when `params.valueChange` is a negative number, both sides will be losing money.

## Impact

The trading PNL (`valueChange`) can not be settled properly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Settle the `valueChange` differently according to the `poolType`.

If `poolType != FLOAT_TYPE`, check for `poolType`; else, check for `underBalancedSide`.
