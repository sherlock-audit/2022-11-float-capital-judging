# Missing `gemCollecting` modifier will result in a user having to either put in more value than he wanted in protocol or lose on gem value

## Summary
The `mintFloatPool()` method in `MarketCore` is missing the `gemCollecting` modifier. This means that if a user mints a float pool he won't collect his gems and if he wants to do this he would have to execute a second mint (with the other mint methods) which means he will have to put in more value in the protocol even though this might not be desired by him.

## Vulnerability Detail
All of the `mint` methods in `MarketCore` have the `gemCollecting` modifier, which will increase the gem balance for a user. All, but one - the `mintFloatPool` method. This is not documented and means that even though a user will expect to collect his gems on each `mint`, if he uses the `mintFloatPool` functionality he won't collect any gems. Now if he wants to collect them he would have to execute another `mint`, again contributing at least 1e18 of `paymentToken` as per the `require` check in `_mint()`. If he doesn't want to execute another `mint` or just doesn't have enough balance he would have to lose on the gems he would have collected.
## Impact
The impact is a potential loss of gems value for a user or a need to contribute more `paymentToken` than he desired to the protocol, if he uses `mintFloatPool()` functionality.
