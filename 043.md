# The short side should also pay the funding fee

## Summary

The current implementation will always charge the funding fees from the long side and wrongfully credit the funding fee to the short side when they should actually pay for it.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both `overbalancedFunding` and `underbalancedFunding` in `_calculateFundingAmount()` are `uint256`, so `fundingAmount[0]` will always be a negative number.

As a result, `_rebalancePoolsAndExecuteBatchedActions()` at L146-147, the short side will always be credited for the funding fee instead of paying for it.

## Impact

Wrong accounting of funding fees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using uint256 for the `fundingAmount` for both sides:

```solidity
  function _calculateFundingAmount(
    uint256 overbalancedIndex,
    uint256 overbalancedValue,
    uint256 underbalancedValue
  ) internal view returns (uint256[2] memory fundingAmount) {
    /*
    totalFunding is calculated on the notional of between long and short liquidity and 2x long and short liquidity. 
    The notional on which funding is calculated increaseas as the imbalance increases.
    The split of funding paid between underbalanced and overbalanced is 50/50 when long = short liq and moves
    linearly to 100% paid by the overbalanced beyong the point where liquidity is 2:1 ratio
    (liquidity in overbalanced side is more than double liquidity in underbalanced side)
    This modular function is logical but naive implementation that will likely change somewhat upon more indepth 
    modelling results that are still pending. 
    */

    // fundingRateMultiplier is in basis points so need to divide by 10,000.
    uint256 totalFunding = (2 * overbalancedValue * fundingRateMultiplier * oracleManager.EPOCH_LENGTH()) / (365.25 days * 10000);

    uint256 overbalancedFunding = Math.min(
      totalFunding,
      (totalFunding * ((2 * overbalancedValue) - underbalancedValue)) / (overbalancedValue + underbalancedValue)
    );
    uint256 underbalancedFunding = totalFunding - overbalancedFunding;

    if (overbalancedIndex == SHORT_TYPE) fundingAmount = [overbalancedFunding, underbalancedFunding];
    else fundingAmount = [underbalancedFunding, overbalancedFunding];
  }
```
