# `latestRoundData() Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated

## Summary
Chainlink latestRoundData invalid validation
Found by: @Tomosuke0930

## Vulnerability Detail
Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated. There is no check for stale price and round completeness. Price can be stale and can lead to wrong answer return value.

## Impact
Round may not complete

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/unchain-dev/2022-11-float-capital-UNCHAIN/blob/main/contracts/market/template/MarketExtended.sol#L37
```solidity
  (uint80 latestRoundId, int256 initialAssetPrice, , , ) = oracleManager.chainlinkOracle().latestRoundData();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You should change as follows:
```solidity
// before
(uint80 latestRoundId, int256 initialAssetPrice, , , ) = oracleManager.chainlinkOracle().latestRoundData();

// after
(uint80 latestRoundId, int256 initialAssetPrice, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = oracleManager.chainlinkOracle().latestRoundData();
require(initialAssetPrice, > 0, "Price <= 0");
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "ChainLink: Stale price");
require(timestamp > 0, "ChainLink: Round not complete");
```
