# `price` can be 0 due to precision loss and further cause `_rebalancePoolsAndExecuteBatchedActions()` to revert

## Summary

`price` is the value of the poolToken, calculated based on the total pool value div by the total supply of the pooltoken. When one of the pools lost almost all its value, its price will become 0 due to precision loss and cause `_rebalancePoolsAndExecuteBatchedActions()` to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

A pool's value will decrease because of the loss from `valueChange` and `funding` over time, and one of the pools' `poolValue` may get lower and lower over time and eventually becomes too low so that at L163 `uint256 price = uint256(poolValue).div(tokenSupply);` can become 0 because of precision loss.

## Impact

As a result, `_processAllBatchedEpochActions()` will revert at L579 due to div by 0.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a new function to properly handle the bankruptcy of a specific pool.
