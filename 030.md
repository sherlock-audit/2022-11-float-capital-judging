# Market Liquidity Manger cannot be initialized, bricking admin

## Summary

MarketLiquidityManagerSimple.sol has both a constructor and an `initialize()` function, both of which have the `initializer` modifier. Because the constructor is called first, the result is that the `initialize()` function is uncallable, and its functionality (setting up the contract admin) is not accessible.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `initializer` modifier from OpenZeppelin only allows a function to be called once, and then writes the storage variable `_initialized = true` to ensure it is not called again.

```solidity
    modifier initializer() {
        bool isTopLevelCall = !_initializing;
        require(
            (isTopLevelCall && _initialized < 1) || (!AddressUpgradeable.isContract(address(this)) && _initialized == 1),
            "Initializable: contract is already initialized"
        );
        _initialized = 1;
        if (isTopLevelCall) {
            _initializing = true;
        }
        _;
        if (isTopLevelCall) {
            _initializing = false;
            emit Initialized(1);
        }
    }
```
After a function with `initializer` is called, the `_initialized` variable is set to true, and any function marked with `initializer` will fail.

[Here is a Gist with a copy & paste Forge test that can be used to verify the error.](https://gist.github.com/zobront/14ade33b40b7c5a05ddc3a44630e89fd)

## Impact

The `initialize()` function sets the admin parameter for the contract. As a result of it failing, there will be no admin on the contract, bricking upgradability.

## Recommendation

Remove the `initializer` modifier from the constructor.
