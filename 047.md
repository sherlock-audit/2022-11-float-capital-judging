# `valueChange` is not applied to the `underBalancedSide` correctly in `_rebalancePoolsAndExecuteBatchedActions()`

## Summary

`valueChange` should be credited to the winning side (long or short) fully if they are the overbalanced side.

But for the underbalanced side, it should only take a portion of the PNL because the float pool will take the rest.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of `_rebalancePoolsAndExecuteBatchedActions()` will apply all the `valueChange` to both sides as both the long side and the short side will go into the branch of L138-150.

At L146-147, `params.valueChange` is applied fully regardless if the current `poolType` is `underBalancedSide`.

## Impact

The part of the PNL that belongs to the exposure provided by the float pool (`floatPoolLeverage`)  of the underbalanced side will be double counted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The PNL of the underbalanced side should be shared between the float pool and the underbalanced side pool.
