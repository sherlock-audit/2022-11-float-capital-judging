# Chainlink’s getRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

## Summary
Chainlink’s getRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract OracleManager.sol calls out to a Chainlink oracle receiving the getRoundData(). 
If there is a problem with Chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. Chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale or incorrect data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).


## Impact
Stale prices that do not reflect the current market price anymore could be used which would influence the membership and cost share pricing.

## Code Snippet
File: main/contracts/oracles/OracleManager.sol

L88:

 (, previousPrice, , , ) = chainlinkOracle.getRoundData(latestExecutedOracleRoundId);

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend adding the following checks:

 (, previousPrice, , , ) = chainlinkOracle.getRoundData(latestExecutedOracleRoundId);

    require(previousPrice >= 0, "Previous price");
