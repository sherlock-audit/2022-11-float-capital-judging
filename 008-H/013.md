# Creating a pool for USDC requires a very large amount of seed capital to be burned

## Summary

When adding a pool to an existing market the contract requires an underlying seed payment to prevent share ratio manipulation. It requires and initial seed of 1e12. For 18 decimals tokens this is a fraction of a token but for USDC which is 6 decimals, this amounts to 100,000 USDC tokens. If pool creator is set for max approval they may not even notice and burn $100,000 in USDC.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function _addPoolToExistingMarket(
      SinglePoolInitInfo memory initPool,
      uint256 initialActualLiquidityForNewPool,
      address seederAndAdmin,
      uint32 _marketIndex
    ) internal {
      require(seederAndAdmin != address(0), "Invalid seederAndAdmin can't be zero");
      // You require at least 1e12 (1 payment token with 12 decimal places) of the underlying payment token to seed the market.
      require(initialActualLiquidityForNewPool >= 1e12, "Insufficient market seed");
      require(
        _numberOfPoolsOfType[uint256(initPool.poolType)] < 8 &&
          initPool.token != address(0) &&
          initPool.poolType < PoolType.LAST &&
          (initPool.leverage >= 1e18 && initPool.leverage <= 10e18),
        "Invalid pool params"
      );

MarketExtended#_addPoolToExistingMarket requires that the caller initially seeds the market with 1e12 tokens. For 18 decimal tokens this is a fraction of a token. However USDC is a 6 decimal tokens so 1e12 amounts to 100,000 USDC. The high capital requirement would make starting a pool difficult. To make matters worse this initial liquidity is minted to a dead address meaning 100,000 wouldn't even be recoverable by the caller.

## Impact

USDC pools require a huge initial fee to start and will cause a large loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change initial requirement to 1e6:

      -   require(initialActualLiquidityForNewPool >= 1e12, "Insufficient market seed");
      +   require(initialActualLiquidityForNewPool >= 1e6, "Insufficient market seed");
