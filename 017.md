# Constructor Usage For Upgradable Contract

## Summary

Upgradable contracts must not use traditional constructors.

## Vulnerability Detail

`MarketExtended` has a [constructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-float-capital/blob/main/contracts/market/template/MarketExtended.sol#L13). State that is set via a traditional constructor will not be executed within the context of the contract.

## Impact

- State set at deployment time will not be valid in the context of the contract for market storage.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
constructor(address _paymentToken, IRegistry _registry) initializer MarketStorage(_paymentToken, _registry) {}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Assign the MarketStorage state within the `initialize()` function
